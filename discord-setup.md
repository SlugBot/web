Title: SlugBot in Discord
---
# First-time discord setup
Once you've invited Slugbot to your discord server, there is some initial setup that should be done to get everything up and running. This section will explain the setup process.

## Setting Channels For SlugBot to Use:
SlugBot needs to know what channels to use for _Welcome Messages_, _Member Events_, _Stream Notifications_, _Leaderboard_, and _Logging_. Use the !`setchannel` command to see what channels you need to set and what channels have been set already.

__Use `!setchannel default` in the channel you want SlugBot to use__ to set that channel as the default channel (`#general` is a good choice).

Do the same for `!setchannel leaderboard`, `!setchannel streams`, `!setchannel memberevents`, and `!setchannel log`. Make sure the channel permissions are as you want them; The logging channel should be private and only visible to moderators, for example.

A set channel can be unset using `!setchannel <channel> reset`.
​
## Setting Roles For SlugBot to Use:
First use the `!setrole` command to see what roles can be set for SlugBot's use. First create the roles you plan for SlugBot to use then set them using `!setrole <role to set> <role name>`. For example, create a role in Server Settings called 'Newcomer' and assign it as the global role with `!setrole global newcomer`.

* The `global` role is given to every member regardless of rank (not required).
* `WeeklyTopRank` and `totalTopRank` are given to the highest weekly scorer and highest total scorer respectively.
* The `mute` role is given to members who have been muted by a moderator. If no mute role is set by an admin, a mute role is generated by slugbot with the correct permissions when the mute command is used for the first time.
* `pc`, `ps4`, and `xbox` are used for self-settable platform roles. Setting the platform roles will create clones of the set roles that allow members to opt out of role pings. Member events will also use these roles to add information to the notifications.

​
## Setting Roles to be Given when a Member Reaches a Certain Level:
SlugBot can be used to give members roles to members who have been active in the server and reached a specific level. This can be done using the `!roleatlevel` command. To add a role to be given at level use the format `!roleatlevel add <role> <level> [sendNotification?]`. The optional argument `sendnotification` requires either true or false to state whether a notification should be sent telling the member they have gained the role upon reaching the required level.

Example: `!roleatlevel add Trusted 10 true`

To stop a role being given at a level, use the following format: `!roleatlevel remove <role name>`.
​
​
## Miscellaneous Settings
The welcome message sent by SlugBot when a new member joins can be customised using the `!setwelcomemessage <your welcome message>` command. Any instance of `${member}` in the welcome message will be replaced with the display name of the new member.

You may have role pings enabled but also want to give members the option to opt out of receiving said pings. Use the `!optoutpings` command to toggle whether to allow members to opt out of role pings.

SlugBots command prefix can be set using `!setprefix <new prefix>`.
