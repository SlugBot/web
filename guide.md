# SlugBot User Guide
The following page will provide an easy-to-follow overview on how to install and run SlugBot in your Discord server or Twtich chat, and how to get the most out of it.


HOOOOOLD UP

*****************************

So this is a test of linking commands and adding a modal alongside them. Here's a link to a test command, existing in `commands.json`: <span class="command-link" data-command="test_command"/>. Pretty nifty, huh? Here's another: <span class="command-link" data-command="other_test_cmd"/>, and <span class="command-link" data-command="roll"/> to boot with it.

# Discord setup

## Streamers and Stream Notifications
SlugBot intergrates with Twitch.tv allowing it to notify when your selected streamers go live. After specifying your `streams` channel and adding some streamers to look out for, SlugBot will send a notification message to the `streams` channel when those streamers go live. SlugBot will also delete the notification when the stream goes offline.

</div>

### Set a Channel for SlugBot to Use
First you'll want to set a channel in your server for SlugBot to send stream notifications in. Use the `!setchannel streams` command __in the channel you want SlugBot to use__.
### Add Streamers to the Streamer List. 
This can be done in a couple ways, using the `!streamer` command or using a `streamer` role.
* Adding a streamer to the steamer list is as easy as using the command `!streamer add <twitch username>`. Streamers can be removed from the list with `!steamer remove <twitch username>`, and the full streamer list can be viewed using `!streamer list`.
	
* Using a `streamer` role requires a little more setup but streamlines the process for streamers that are also members of your server. Use the `!setrole streamer <streamer role name>` command to specify a role for SlugBot to use. Now any member given this role will be added to the streamer list __provided they have linked their discord account with their twitch account through SlugBot__. 

The linking process is done using the command `!twitch <your twitch name>`. This link need only be made once per discord account.

One benefit of using the streamer role method is that it works synergisticly with the `!giveme` command - allowing the streamer role to be self-assigned by members of your server. Make the `streamer` role self-assignable using the command `!giveme add <streamer role name>`. Members can then use the command `!giveme <streamer role>` to assign the role to themselves and have their streams appear in the streams channel.



# First-time discord setup
Once you've invited Slugbot to your discord server, there is some initial setup that should be done to get everything up and running. This section will explain the setup process.

## Setting Channels For SlugBot to Use:
SlugBot needs to know what channels to use for _Welcome Messages_, _Member Events_, _Stream Notifications_, _Leaderboard_, and _Logging_. Use the !`setchannel` command to see what channels you need to set and what channels have been set already.

__Use `!setchannel default` in the channel you want SlugBot to use__ to set that channel as the default channel (`#general` is a good choice).

Do the same for `!setchannel leaderboard`, `!setchannel streams`, `!setchannel memberevents`, and `!setchannel log`. Make sure the channel permissions are as you want them; The logging channel should be private and only visible to moderators, for example.

A set channel can be unset using `!setchannel <channel> reset`.
​
## Setting Roles For SlugBot to Use:
Use the `!setrole` command to see what roles can be set for SlugBot's use. You will want to create the roles you plan for SlugBot to use first, then set them using `!setrole <role to set> <role name>`. For example, create a role in Server Settings called 'Newcomer' and assign it as the global role with `!setrole global newcomer`.

* The set `global` role is given to every member when they join the server. This will be applied to members retroactively - any existing member without the role will be given it when they next send a message.
* `WeeklyTopRank` and `totalTopRank` are given to the highest weekly scorer and highest total scorer respectively.
* The `mute` role is given to members who have been muted by a moderator. If no mute role is set by an admin, a mute role is generated by slugbot with the correct permissions when the mute command is used for the first time. It is recommended to let SlugBot generate this role.
* `pc`, `ps4`, and `xbox` are used for self-settable platform roles. Setting the platform roles will create clones of the set roles that allow members to opt out of role pings. Member events will also use these roles to add information to the notifications.
* The `botAdmin` role can be set to allow with this role access to SlugBot admin commands without needing to give them the server administrator permission.
* the `streamer` role works in conjunction with SlugBots twitch stream notifications. Any member with this role will have their streams linked in a set

## Setting Roles to be Given when a Member Reaches a Certain Level:
SlugBot can be used to give members roles to members who have been active in the server and reached a specific level. This can be done using the `!roleatlevel` command. To add a role to be given at level use the format `!roleatlevel add <role> <level> [sendNotification?]`. The optional argument `sendnotification` requires either true or false to state whether a notification should be sent telling the member they have gained the role upon reaching the required level.

Example: `!roleatlevel add Trusted 10 true`

To stop a role being given at a level, use the following format: `!roleatlevel remove <role name>`.
​
​
## Miscellaneous Settings
The welcome message sent by SlugBot when a new member joins can be customised using the `!setwelcomemessage <your welcome message>` command. Any instance of `${member}` in the welcome message will be replaced with the display name of the new member.

You may have role pings enabled but also want to give members the option to opt out of receiving said pings. Use the `!optoutpings` command to toggle whether to allow members to opt out of role pings.

SlugBots command prefix can be set using `!setprefix <new prefix>`.

# Setting Up SmugSlugBot for Twitch.tv for the First Time
First you will need SlugBot to join your twitch chat; This can be done by pinging `@Narcolept`, I guess? SlugBot will lurk in your twitch chat until activated.
​
​
## Activating Modules
SlugBot's twitch.tv modules can be activated independently; This allows you to prevent conflicts with other bots you may have in your chat.

To activate a module, enter the command `!activate <module>` in your twitch chat. There are 8 modules: `uptime`, `build`, `igot`, `roll`, `customCommands`, `slugballs`, `so` and `follows`. They can be activated/deactivated one at a time or multiple can be activated/deactivated by listing the modules as follows: `!activate uptime build`. This will activate both `uptime` and `build`.

Alternatively, you can activate/deactivate all modules using the command `!activate slugbot` or `!deactivate slugbot`.
​
