# SlugBot User Guide
The following page will provide an easy-to-follow overview on how to install and run SlugBot in your Discord server or Twtich chat, and how to get the most out of it.

# Discord setup

## Streamers and Stream Notifications
SlugBot intergrates with Twitch.tv allowing it to notify when your selected streamers go live. After specifying your `streams` channel using <span class="command-link" data-command="setchannel"/> and adding some streamers to look out for using <span class="command-link" data-command="streamer"/>, SlugBot will send a notification message to the `streams` channel when those streamers go live. SlugBot will also delete the notification when the stream goes offline.

<div class="note">
	Setting a streamer role using <span class="command-link" data-command="setrole"></span> allows a role to specify a member as a streamer for SlugBot to look out for and post notifications in the streams channel.
</div>

### Set a Channel for SlugBot to Use
First you'll want to set a channel in your server for SlugBot to send stream notifications in. Use the `!setchannel streams` command __in the channel you want SlugBot to use__.
### Add Streamers to the Streamer List. 
This can be done in a couple ways, using the `!streamer` command or using a `streamer` role.
* Adding a streamer to the steamer list is as easy as using the command `!streamer add <twitch username>`. Streamers can be removed from the list with `!steamer remove <twitch username>`, and the full streamer list can be viewed using `!streamer list`.
	
* Using a `streamer` role requires a little more setup but streamlines the process for streamers that are also members of your server. Use the `!setrole streamer <streamer role name>` command to specify a role for SlugBot to use. Now any member given this role will be added to the streamer list __provided they have linked their discord account with their twitch account through SlugBot__. 

The linking process is done using the command `!twitch <your twitch name>`. This link need only be made once per discord account.

One benefit of using the streamer role method is that it works synergisticly with the `!giveme` command - allowing the streamer role to be self-assigned by members of your server. Make the `streamer` role self-assignable using the command `!giveme add <streamer role name>`. Members can then use the command `!giveme <streamer role>` to assign the role to themselves and have their streams appear in the streams channel.



# First-time discord setup
Once you've invited Slugbot to your discord server, there is some initial setup that should be done to get everything up and running. This section will explain the setup process.

## Setting Channels For SlugBot to Use:
SlugBot needs to know what channels to use for _Welcome Messages_, _Member Events_, _Stream Notifications_, _Leaderboard_, and _Logging_. Use the !`setchannel` command to see what channels you need to set and what channels have been set already.

__Use `!setchannel default` in the channel you want SlugBot to use__ to set that channel as the default channel (`#general` is a good choice).

Do the same for `!setchannel leaderboard`, `!setchannel streams`, `!setchannel memberevents`, and `!setchannel log`. Make sure the channel permissions are as you want them; The logging channel should be private and only visible to moderators, for example.

A set channel can be unset using `!setchannel <channel> reset`.
​
## Setting Roles For SlugBot to Use:
Use the `!setrole` command to see what roles can be set for SlugBot's use. You will want to create the roles you plan for SlugBot to use first, then set them using `!setrole <role to set> <role name>`. For example, create a role in Server Settings called 'Newcomer' and assign it as the global role with `!setrole global newcomer`.

* The set `global` role is given to every member when they join the server. This will be applied to members retroactively - any existing member without the role will be given it when they next send a message.
* `WeeklyTopRank` and `totalTopRank` are given to the highest weekly scorer and highest total scorer respectively.
* The `mute` role is given to members who have been muted by a moderator. If no mute role is set by an admin, a mute role is generated by slugbot with the correct permissions when the mute command is used for the first time. It is recommended to let SlugBot generate this role.
* `pc`, `ps4`, and `xbox` are used for self-settable platform roles. Setting the platform roles will create clones of the set roles that allow members to opt out of role pings. Member events will also use these roles to add information to the notifications.
* The `botAdmin` role can be set to allow with this role access to SlugBot admin commands without needing to give them the server administrator permission.
* the `streamer` role works in conjunction with SlugBots twitch stream notifications. Any member with this role will have their streams linked in a set

## Setting Roles to be Given when a Member Reaches a Certain Level:
SlugBot can be used to give members roles to members who have been active in the server and reached a specific level. This can be done using the `!roleatlevel` command. To add a role to be given at level use the format `!roleatlevel add <role> <level> [sendNotification?]`. The optional argument `sendnotification` requires either true or false to state whether a notification should be sent telling the member they have gained the role upon reaching the required level.

Example: `!roleatlevel add Trusted 10 true`

To stop a role being given at a level, use the following format: `!roleatlevel remove <role name>`.
​
​
## Miscellaneous Settings
The welcome message sent by SlugBot when a new member joins can be customised using the `!setwelcomemessage <your welcome message>` command. Any instance of `${member}` in the welcome message will be replaced with the display name of the new member.

You may have role pings enabled but also want to give members the option to opt out of receiving said pings. Use the `!optoutpings` command to toggle whether to allow members to opt out of role pings.

SlugBots command prefix can be set using `!setprefix <new prefix>`.

# Slug Economy
Like some other bots, SlugBot has an Economy module, letting users earn and trade currency in the form of SlugCoin. However, SlugBot's economy allows users to 'hack' other members, steal from them or plant malware on their accounts. The aim of the game is to earn as much SlugCoin as you can while also protecting your account from other members.

## The Basics
Your account holds all of your Slug Economy data, including your bank balance, stats, info on your processes and marks, along with info on your detected security breaches. Use the `!slugs` command to view your account menu. All accounts are protected by a **FIREWALL** that will prevent any tampering with your account. but that can be **BYPASS**ed given enough time.

Your bank holds SlugCoin in two ways; **Current** and **Vault**. **Current** has infinite capacity but is more vulnerable to malware and theft. your **Vault** is much more secure but has limited capacity determined by your **POWER Lvl**. Use the `!vault [amount]` to transfer SC from your current to your vault.

The easiest way to start earning is through Daily SlugCoin collection and passive SlugCoin earning. 

Once per day, you can use the `!daily` command to earn between 100SC and 300SC.
You will also earn a small amount every few minutes while you are active in the server.

If you are feeling generous, you can give SC to others using the `!giveslugs <target> <amount>` command. On the other hand, you can *take* SC from accounts you have **CRACK**ed using `!takeslugs <target> amount`.

## Processes and Malware
The best way to make SC is to steal, either directly or through the effects of malware. First you'll want to **BYPASS** your target's **FIREWALL** using the `!bypass <target>` command. This will begin the **BYPASS** process.

Most processes take time - be that **BYPASS**ing, **SCAN**ning for malware, or planting malware of your own on someones account. The time a process takes is usually determined by your offensive stat and your target's defensive stat.

Once you've **BYPASS**ed a user's **FIREWALL** you'll have access to their account. Use `!bypass <target>` command again to open their account menu and view their info. You won't be able to take anything from their bank balance just yet, however. Their SC are still protected by their bank **ENCRYPTION** which will need to be **CRACK**ed - a time consuming process (`!crack <target>`). But access to their account now lets you plant various types of malware on them.

### SKIMMER
```!plant skimmer <target> <fraction to skim>```
This malware, once planted on a user, will skim a fraction of all income the infected user receives and transfer them to the planter instead.

### BYPASS_VIRUS
```!plant bypass_virus <target>```
When a user with this malware planted on them **BYPASS**es another, the planter of this malware will also gain access to that account.

### LEECH
```!plant leech <target> <amount/hour>```
This malware will siphon an amount of SC out of a users current account and transfer it to the planter every hour. Requires that the users **ENCRYPTION** has been **CRACK**ed.

*More coming soon...*

## Scanning and Cleaning
You are going to want to make sure your account is malware free - but malware isn't always easy to detect. Use the `!scan [attacker] [malware type]` command to start a **SCAN** process. Scans cost SC - so be careful about performing them too often. You can optionally state a suspected attacker or specify a malware type to limit your search to; doing so will increase the likelihood of successfully identifying malware but will also limit which malware will be detected.

Once you've **SCAN**ned, any detected malware will be displayed in your INBOUND MALWARE menu tab. You may see that some details of the malware are still unidentified. Some malware may require a few **SCAN**s to fully identify.

You can also identify malware by accessing the attacker's account and viewing their OUTBOUND MALWARE.

You can then use `!clean` to begin removing the malware from your account. The more malware detected, the longer this process will take. The more properties of a malware identified, the more likely it will be successfully removed.

## Stats
Stats determine how long it takes for processes to complete, how effective malware is, or how secure your account is. For example, a higher **FIREWALL** stat will mean it will take longer for others to **BYPASS** it and access your account. You can level up using the command `!levelup <stat>` but it will cost SC. Every 5 stats leveled increases your POWER Lvl by 1.

# Setting Up SmugSlugBot for Twitch.tv for the First Time
First you will need SlugBot to join your twitch chat; This can be done by pinging `@Narcolept`, I guess? SlugBot will lurk in your twitch chat until activated.
​
​
## Activating Modules
SlugBot's twitch.tv modules can be activated independently; This allows you to prevent conflicts with other bots you may have in your chat.

To activate a module, enter the command `!activate <module>` in your twitch chat. There are 8 modules: `uptime`, `build`, `igot`, `roll`, `customCommands`, `slugballs`, `so` and `follows`. They can be activated/deactivated one at a time or multiple can be activated/deactivated by listing the modules as follows: `!activate uptime build`. This will activate both `uptime` and `build`.

Alternatively, you can activate/deactivate all modules using the command `!activate slugbot` or `!deactivate slugbot`.
​
