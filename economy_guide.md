# SlugBot Economy Guide
Like some other bots, SlugBot has an Economy module, letting users earn and trade currency in the form of SlugCoin. However, SlugBot's economy allows users to 'hack' other members, steal from them or plant malware on their accounts. The aim of the game is to earn as much SlugCoin as you can while also protecting your account from other members.

# The Basics
Your account holds all of your Slug Economy data, including your bank balance, stats, info on your processes and marks, along with info on your detected security breaches. Use the <span class="command-link" data-command="slugs"/> command to view your account menu. All accounts are protected by a **FIREWALL** that will prevent any tampering with your account. but that can be **BYPASS**ed given enough time.
